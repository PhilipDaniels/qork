Rust Learning
=============
Formatting of SystemTime is really difficult! Need to bring in chrono
and then Google for the special magic function to convert a SystemTime
into a DateTime.

C# to Rust
==========
To make a struct with private immutable data, just declare a field, then a pub fn with the
same name which returns a reference to that data. Methods should take a reference otherwise
you will get confusing compiler errors about lifetimes (because you moved an object).


NEXT
====
Add target-info.
--create-config-dir : creates a skeleton configuration directory - need to define it!


Logging Levels
==============
trace, debug, info, warn, error, crit.
debug only appears in Debug mode builds. trace does not appear at all by default.
