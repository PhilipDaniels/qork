Rust Learning
=============
Formatting of SystemTime is really difficult! Need to bring in chrono
and then Google for the special magic function to convert a SystemTime
into a DateTime.

Crates on crates.io should say which platforms they support.

Just printing a PathBuf is difficult. Why do we need this OsString type as well
as &str and String?

A struct with a lifetime always means that struct depends on other locations to hold the "meat" of the data.
You are instructing the compiler to prove that values of the struct type never outlive those locations.


C# to Rust
==========
To make a struct with private immutable data, just declare a field, then a pub fn with the
same name which returns a reference to that data. Methods should take a reference otherwise
you will get confusing compiler errors about lifetimes (because you moved an object).


NEXT
====
* Create a UserInfo struct.
* --create-config-dir : creates a skeleton configuration directory - need to define it!
* Consider removing hostname and replacing with the more widely applicable nix crate.
  This would be good for getting the user info, but is not a solution for Windows.

Logging Levels
==============
trace, debug, info, warn, error, crit.
debug only appears in Debug mode builds. trace does not appear at all by default.

Thoughts On Rust
================
I just discovered you can browse the source directly on docs.rs - this is a fantastic learning resource!
Platforms show up on docs.rs, but why is that not on crates.io?
